Logical Operators:-
○ are used for conditions comparison that basically checks for the validity of
them

○ They are also used in loops as part of termination conditions.

○ If the first condition is enough to give the final verdict, it will not evaluate
the second one.

○ 3 operators are there:

■ && - logical AND, returns true when both conditions evaluates to true

■ || - logical OR, returns true when either of the conditions evaluates to
true

■ ! - logical not, return true when condition evaluates to false

○ Example:
var a=true,b=false;
console.log('a&&b : '+ (a&&b));
console.log('a||b : '+ (a||b));
console.log('!a : '+ (!a));
Output
a&&b : false
a||b : true
!a : false
