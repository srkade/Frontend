Bitwise Operators:-
○ It computes by going bit by bit

○ Both side is checked irrespective of what first expression computes to

○ 4 major bit operators are:
■ & - bitwise and, which returns 1 if both bits are 1 else 0.

■ | - bitwise or, which returns 1 if either of bits is 1 else 0.

■ ^ - bitwise xor, which returns 1 if both bits are different else 0.

■ ~ - bitwise not, which changes 1 to 0 and vice versa.






○ Example:
var a=8,b=2;
console.log('a&b : '+ (a&b));
console.log('a|b : '+ (a|b));
console.log('a^b : '+ (a^b));
console.log('~a : '+ (~a));
