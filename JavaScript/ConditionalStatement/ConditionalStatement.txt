Conditional Statements - if else
○ consist of 2 keywords, if and else
○ This is a way where there are 2 paths possible depending upon a condition
○ if condition manipulates to true then if gets executed otherwise code is else
will execute
○ you can multiple else if followed by else if there are more possible paths.
○ Also nested if and else are possible
○ Example:
var a=5,b=6;
if(a+b==11)
console.log("equal");
else
console.log("not equal");
Output
equal

Conditional Statements - switch
○ It is an elegant way to replace multiple else-if
○ Syntax:
switch(expression)
{
case val: ... ;
break;
case val: ... ;
break;
case val: ... ;
break;
default: ...;
}

○ Here depending upon the answer evaluated by the condition, case
code gets executed.
○ every case must be followed by break unless it is required not to as
per logic. Otherwise, all cases will start executing from the matched
case till either break is encountered or all cases gets exhausted
○ default is optional and holds the code which should be executed if no
catches gets matched.
○ val can be integer, char or String in javascript.
