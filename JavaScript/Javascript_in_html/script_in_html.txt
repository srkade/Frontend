There are two ways of applying script to the webpage
1.Internal script :-
here applying javascript in the same html document by using 
script tag 

2.External javascript
we create a new javascript file with .js extension and linking
to the current html page by script tag with src attribute
and provide path of the file 

External JavaScript Advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags
