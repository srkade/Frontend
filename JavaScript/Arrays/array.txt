Array:

It is used to store ordered data together.
:-Array are Collection of different data types in single variable
● It is defined within square brackets( [ ] ) and can have elements of different types
var a=[1,true,'hello']
a[2]
"hello"
● You can also leave sime position
var a=[2,3,,4]
a[2]
undefined
a
(4) [2, 3, empty, 4]


Array Methods - Push and Pop
● They are used to add and delete elements from last respectively
● Example
let arr = [1,2];
arr.push(3);
arr
(3) [1, 2, 3]
arr.pop();
arr
(2) [1, 2]


Array Methods - Unshift and Shift
● They are used to add and delete elements from front respectively
● Example
let arr = [1,2];
arr.unshift(3);
arr
(3) [3, 1, 2]
arr.shift();
arr
(2) [1, 2]


Array Methods - Splice
● It used to add new elements in the array from specified to and from index
● Example
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
arr.splice(1,3,"hello");
arr
(3) [1, "hello", 5]
Elements from index 1 to 3(inclusive) are replaced by hello
● Splice can also be used to delete the elements from the array
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
arr.splice(1,3);
arr
(2) [1, 5]


Array Methods - Slice
● It can help one to create new array from existing array
● Example
let arr1 = arr.slice(1);
arr1
(4) [2, 3, 4, 5]
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
let arr1 = arr.slice(1,3);
arr1
(2) [2,3]
Elements from index 1 to 3(exclusive) are assigned to arr1


Array Printing
● Array can be printed using for, for each, for in or for of
● Using for
for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
console.log(arr[i]+" ");
23
cat
[object Object]
● Using forEach()
arr.forEach(item => console.log(item+" "));



Array Printing
● Using for of
for(item of arr)
console.log(item+" ");
● Using for in
● used for enumerables i.e, objects
● it can also be used for iterables in which index acts as key
for(item in arr)
console.log(item+" ");
